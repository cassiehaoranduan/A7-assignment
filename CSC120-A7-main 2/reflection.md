Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In House.java, I decided to overload constructor. The first one takes three parameters: name, address, and floor. And assume this house has a dining hall and an elevator. The second one takes four parameters: name, address, floors, and dining room. I assume this house don't have an elevator.
In Cafe.java, I decided to overload constructor. The first one takes two parameters: name and address. The second one takes 4 parameters: name, address, cups and creams. I assume this cafe has 1000 cups and 1000 creams.
In library.java, I decided to overload constructor too. The fist one takes two parameters: name and address. The second one takes three parameters: name, address, and books. 
I choose constructor to overload is because in this way, the program is easier to more likely to compile without errors or warnings.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
At first, I didn't know how to override goToFloor in library, cafe and house. I put the assignment away for one hour, and when I came back from my dinner, I realized that I'm thinking way much. It is very simple: I'm in a house with no elevator, when I want to go to 3rd floor but I'm at 1th floor right now, I have to call goUp. I thought I need to make a lot of changes in goToFloor, so I was really stressful, but actually there's no need to. Just try to figure out the logic, and then you will immediately know how to write your code!
In this assignment, it is really important for students to understand the concept of override and overload, and can tell the difference between them. If students are not familiar with these two concepts, they will find it very hard and complicated, and they may spend a lot of time on doing this. Still, follow the readme's guide step by step, and make sure you take the hint!
